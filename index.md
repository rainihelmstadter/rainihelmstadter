# Raini's Earth Data Science Portfolio 

Hello! I am from Santa Fe, New Mexico. I went to Hampshire College, which is a pretty small school in western Massachusetts, down the road from UMass Amherst and Amherst College. I studied Climate Science, Philosophy, and Environmental Policy at Hampshire, and completed a thesis that explored a novel way to present climate model data so they are more relevant to general stakeholders. I taught myself how to use Matlab during my thesis time, but I'm really looking forward to learning a more widely used language and getting a more systematic education on coding. I'm planning on applying to graduate school this fall, probably in Geography or Atmospheric Science (potentially at CU!). My interests lie in connecting stakeholders with climate model outputs in order to facilitate adaptation and mitigation efforts. If you have thoughts, questions, recommendations, etc. - I'm all ears!

Since graduating, I've been skiing... a lot. I love skiing at the resort and in the backcountry, and I love getting to talk about it with fellow ski nerds. When not skiing, you'll probably find me mountain biking or trail running.

I'm really excited about utilizing the growing pool of Earth Science data and techniques with global and regional climate model outputs to improve accuracy in mountainous regions and aid adaptation efforts.
